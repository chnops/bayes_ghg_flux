Bayesian Greenhouse Gas Flux Model
==================================

This repository is for work developing a bayesian model for greenhouse gas flux estimation using
static chamber methods.

The Bayesian model used here is coded in JAGS, and JAGS is used via the R package "Rjags".  This
will require downloading JAGS to use the model.

[You can download JAGS here](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)

##There are several scripts in this repository##

1. _data_simulation.R_
  *This script is used to generate a series of 1000 sets of flux measurements.
