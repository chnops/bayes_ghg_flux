Bayesian Greenhouse Gas Flux Model
==================================

This repository is for work developing a bayesian model for greenhouse gas flux estimation using
static chamber methods.

The Bayesian model used here is coded in JAGS, and JAGS is used via the R package "Rjags".  This
will require downloading JAGS to use the model.
